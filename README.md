OPC UA Method based order distribution for one or many OPC UA Clients!   
A PLC or any other OPC UA Client can request carrierdata (read from database) or can set carrierdata (write to a database) in a service oriented way  
  
It implements just one of many features a MES should have, but many people struggle connecting IT- and OT-World and especially a mission critical database to a fielddevice.  
With OPC UA Methods its very convenient and safe to connect to a database ensuring the query itself to be consistent (typically IT-Domain) and aswell in its types (perfect for plc's)
